Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.","['APP: Social Networks', 'APP: Humanities & Computational Social Science', 'ML: Deep Learning Algorithms']",,"['Le Cheng', 'Peican Zhu', 'Keke Tang', 'Chao Gao', 'Zhen Wang']","['Northwestern Polytechnical University', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University', 'Guangzhou University', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27762,Security,Adversarial Robust Safeguard for Evading Deep Facial Manipulation,"The non-consensual exploitation of facial manipulation has emerged as a pressing societal concern. In tandem with the identification of such fake content, recent research endeavors have advocated countering manipulation techniques through proactive interventions, specifically the incorporation of adversarial noise to impede the manipulation in advance. Nevertheless, with insufficient consideration of robustness, we show that current methods falter in providing protection after simple perturbations, e.g., blur. In addition, traditional optimization-based methods face limitations in scalability as they struggle to accommodate the substantial expansion of data volume, a consequence of the time-intensive iterative pipeline. To solve these challenges, we propose a learning-based model, Adversarial Robust Safeguard (ARS), to generate desirable protection noise in a single forward process, concurrently exhibiting a heightened resistance against prevalent perturbations. Specifically, our method involves a two-way protection design, characterized by a basic protection component responsible for generating efficacious noise features, coupled with robust protection for further enhancement. In robust protection, we first fuse image features with spatially duplicated noise embedding, thereby accounting for inherent information redundancy. Subsequently, a combination comprising a differentiable perturbation module and an adversarial network is devised to simulate potential information degradation during the training process. To evaluate it, we conduct experiments on four manipulation methods and compare recent works comprehensively. The results of our method exhibit good visual effects with pronounced robustness against varied perturbations at different levels.","['APP: Security', 'APP: Misinformation & Fake News']",,"['Jiazhi Guan', 'Yi Zhao', 'Zhuoer Xu', 'Changhua Meng', 'Ke Xu', 'Youjian Zhao']","['DCST, BNRist, Tsinghua University', 'Beijing Institute of Technology', 'Ant Group', 'Ant Group', 'DCST, BNRist, Tsinghua University\nZhongguancun Laboratory', 'DCST, BNRist, Tsinghua University\nZhongguancun Laboratory']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27768,Security,Learning from Polar Representation: An Extreme-Adaptive Model for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting,"In the hydrology field, time series forecasting is crucial for efficient water resource management, improving flood and drought control and increasing the safety and quality of life for the general population. However, predicting long-term streamflow is a complex task due to the presence of extreme events. It requires the capture of long-range dependencies and the modeling of rare but important extreme values. Existing approaches often struggle to tackle these dual challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we specifically delve into these issues and propose Distance-weighted Auto-regularized Neural network (DAN), a novel extreme-adaptive model for long-range forecasting of stremflow enhanced by polar representation learning. DAN utilizes a distance-weighted multi-loss mechanism and stackable blocks to dynamically refine indicator sequences from exogenous data, while also being able to handle uni-variate time-series by employing Gaussian Mixture probability modeling to improve robustness to severe events. We also introduce Kruskal-Wallis sampling and gate control vectors to handle imbalanced extreme data. On four real-life hydrologic streamflow datasets, we demonstrate that DAN significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art hydrologic time series prediction methods and general methods designed for long-term time series prediction.","['APP: Natural Sciences', 'APP: Other Applications', 'ML: Time-Series/Data Streams']",,"['Yanhong Li', 'Jack Xu', 'David Anastasiu']","['Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA', 'Santa Clara Valley Water District, San Jose, CA, USA', 'Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27772,Transparency & Explainability,Root Cause Analysis in Microservice Using Neural Granger Causal Discovery,"In recent years, microservices have gained widespread adoption in IT operations due to their scalability, maintenance, and flexibility. However, it becomes challenging for site reliability engineers (SREs) to pinpoint the root cause due to the complex relationship in microservices when facing system malfunctions. Previous research employed structure learning methods (e.g., PC-algorithm) to establish causal relationships and derive root causes from causal graphs. Nevertheless, they ignored the temporal order of time series data and failed to leverage the rich information inherent in the temporal relationships. For instance, in cases where there is a sudden spike in CPU utilization, it can lead to an increase in latency for other microservices. However, in this scenario, the anomaly in CPU utilization occurs before the latency increases, rather than simultaneously. As a result, the PC-algorithm fails to capture such characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RUN, a novel approach for root cause analysis using neural Granger causal discovery with contrastive learning. RUN enhances the backbone encoder by integrating contextual information from time series and leverages a time series forecasting model to conduct neural Granger causal discovery. In addition, RUN incorporates Pagerank with a personalization vector to efficiently recommend the top-k root causes. Extensive experiments conducted on the synthetic and real-world microservice-based datasets demonstrate that RUN noticeably outperforms the state-of-the-art root cause analysis methods. Moreover, we provide an analysis scenario for the sock-shop case to showcase the practicality and efficacy of RUN in microservice-based applications.

https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27776,Security,StegaStyleGAN: Towards Generic and Practical Generative Image Steganography,"The recent advances in generative image steganography have drawn increasing attention due to their potential for provable security and bulk embedding capacity. However, existing generative steganographic schemes are usually tailored for specific tasks and are hardly applied to applications with practical constraints. To address this issue, this paper proposes a generic generative image steganography scheme called Steganography StyleGAN (StegaStyleGAN) that meets the practical objectives of security, capacity, and robustness within the same framework. In StegaStyleGAN, a novel Distribution-Preserving Secret Data Modulator (DP-SDM) is used to achieve provably secure generative image steganography by preserving the data distribution of the model inputs. Additionally, a generic and efficient Secret Data Extractor (SDE) is invented for accurate secret data extraction. By choosing whether to incorporate the Image Attack Simulator (IAS) during the training process, one can obtain two models with different parameters but the same structure (both generator and extractor) for lossless and lossy channel covert communication, namely StegaStyleGAN-Ls and StegaStyleGAN-Ly. Furthermore, by mating with GAN inversion, conditional generative steganography can be achieved as well. Experimental results demonstrate that, whether for lossless or lossy communication channels, the proposed StegaStyleGAN can significantly outperform the corresponding state-of-the-art schemes.","['APP: Security', 'APP: Social Networks']",,"['Wenkang Su', 'Jiangqun Ni', 'Yiyan Sun']","['Sun Yat-Sen University\nGuangzhou University', 'Sun Yat-Sen University\nPeng Cheng Laboratory', 'Sun Yat-Sen University']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27780,Security,Inspecting Prediction Confidence for Detecting Black-Box Backdoor Attacks,"Backdoor attacks have been shown to be a serious security threat against deep learning models, and various defenses have been proposed to detect whether a model is backdoored or not. However, as indicated by a recent black-box attack, existing defenses can be easily bypassed by implanting the backdoor in the frequency domain. To this end, we propose a new defense DTInspector against black-box backdoor attacks, based on a new observation related to the prediction confidence of learning models. That is, to achieve a high attack success rate with a small amount of poisoned data, backdoor attacks usually render a model exhibiting statistically higher prediction confidences on the poisoned samples. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the generality of this observation. DTInspector then carefully examines the prediction confidences of data samples, and decides the existence of backdoor using the shortcut nature of backdoor triggers. Extensive evaluations on six backdoor attacks, four datasets, and three advanced attacking types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense.",['APP: Security'],,"['Tong Wang', 'Yuan Yao', 'Feng Xu', 'Miao Xu', 'Shengwei An', 'Ting Wang']","['Nanjing University', 'Nanjing University', 'Nanjing University', 'University of Queensland', 'Purdue University', 'Stony Brook University']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27786,Fairness & Bias,Multilevel Attention Network with Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation for Drug-Target Prediction,"Prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a crucial step in drug discovery, and deep learning methods have shown great promise on various DTI datasets. However, existing approaches still face several challenges, including limited labeled data, hidden bias issue, and a lack of generalization ability to out-of-domain data. These challenges hinder the model's capacity to learn truly informative interaction features, leading to shortcut learning and inferior predictive performance on novel drug-target pairs. To address these issues, we propose MlanDTI, a semi-supervised domain adaptive multilevel attention network (Mlan) for DTI prediction. We utilize two pre-trained BERT models to acquire bidirectional representations enriched with information from unlabeled data. Then, we introduce a multilevel attention mechanism, enabling the model to learn domain-invariant DTIs at different hierarchical levels. Moreover, we present a simple yet effective semi-supervised pseudo-labeling method to further enhance our model's predictive ability in cross-domain scenarios. Experiments on four datasets show that MlanDTI achieves state-of-the-art performances over other methods under intra-domain settings and outperforms all other approaches under cross-domain settings.

https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27793,Security,Adversarial Socialbots Modeling Based on Structural Information Principles,"The importance of effective detection is underscored by the fact that socialbots imitate human behavior to propagate misinformation, leading to an ongoing competition between socialbots and detectors. Despite the rapid advancement of reactive detectors, the exploration of adversarial socialbot modeling remains incomplete, significantly hindering the development of proactive detectors. To address this issue, we propose a mathematical Structural Information principles-based Adversarial Socialbots Modeling framework, namely SIASM, to enable more accurate and effective modeling of adversarial behaviors. First, a heterogeneous graph is presented to integrate various users and rich activities in the original social network and measure its dynamic uncertainty as structural entropy. By minimizing the high-dimensional structural entropy, a hierarchical community structure of the social network is generated and referred to as the optimal encoding tree. Secondly, a novel method is designed to quantify influence by utilizing the assigned structural entropy, which helps reduce the computational cost of SIASM by filtering out uninfluential users. Besides, a new conditional structural entropy is defined between the socialbot and other users to guide the follower selection for network influence maximization. Extensive and comparative experiments on both homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed SIASM framework yields substantial performance improvements in terms of network influence (up to 16.32%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to 16.29%) when evaluated against a robust detector with 90% accuracy.","['APP: Social Networks', 'ML: Adversarial Learning & Robustness', 'ML: Graph-based Machine Learning', 'ML: Reinforcement Learning']",,"['Xianghua Zeng', 'Hao Peng', 'Angsheng Li']","['Beihang University, Beijing, China', 'Beihang University, Beijing, China', 'Beihang University\nZhongguancun Laboratory, Beijing, China']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27794,Security,NondBREM: Nondeterministic Offline Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Order Dispatching,"One of the most important tasks in ride-hailing is order dispatching, i.e., assigning unserved orders to available drivers. Recent order dispatching has achieved a significant improvement due to the advance of reinforcement learning, which has been approved to be able to effectively address sequential decision-making problems like order dispatching. However, most existing reinforcement learning methods require agents to learn the optimal policy by interacting with environments online, which is challenging or impractical for real-world deployment due to high costs or safety concerns. For example, due to the spatiotemporally unbalanced supply and demand, online reinforcement learning-based order dispatching may significantly impact the revenue of the ride-hailing platform and passenger experience during the policy learning period. Hence, in this work, we develop an offline deep reinforcement learning framework called NondBREM for large-scale order dispatching, which learns policy from only the accumulated logged data to avoid costly and unsafe interactions with the environment. In NondBREM, a Nondeterministic Batch-Constrained Q-learning (NondBCQ) module is developed to reduce the algorithm extrapolation error and a Random Ensemble Mixture (REM) module that integrates multiple value networks with multi-head networks is utilized to improve the model generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world ride-hailing datasets show the superiority of our design.","['APP: Transportation', 'APP: Mobility', 'Driving & Flight', 'DMKM: Mining of Spatial', 'Temporal or Spatio-Temporal Data']",,"['Hongbo Zhang', 'Guang Wang', 'Xu Wang', 'Zhengyang Zhou', 'Chen Zhang', 'Zheng Dong', 'Yang Wang']","['University of Science and Technology of China', 'Florida State University', 'University of Science and Technology of China', 'University of Science and Technology of China', 'University of Science and Technology of China', 'Wayne State University', 'University of Science and Technology of China']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27796,Privacy & Data Governance,Adversarial Attacks on Federated-Learned Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms,"Learning-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms have revolutionized video streaming solutions. With the growing demand for data privacy and the rapid development of mobile devices, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular training method for neural ABR algorithms in both academia and industry. However, we have discovered that FL-based ABR models are vulnerable to model-poisoning attacks as local updates remain unseen during global aggregation. In response, we propose MAFL (Malicious ABR model based on Federated Learning) to prove that backdooring the learning-based ABR model via FL is practical. Instead of attacking the global policy, MAFL only targets a single ``target client''. Moreover, the unique challenges brought by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) make the attack even more challenging. To address these challenges, MAFL is designed with a two-stage attacking mechanism. Using two representative attack cases with real-world traces, we show that MAFL significantly degrades the model performance on the target client (i.e., increasing rebuffering penalty by 2x and 5x) with a minimal negative impact on benign clients.","['APP: Web', 'ML: Distributed Machine Learning & Federated Learning']",,"['Rui-Xiao Zhang', 'Tianchi Huang']","['The Unversity of Hong Kong', 'Sony Group Corporation']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27803,Fairness & Bias,Trend-Aware Supervision: On Learning Invariance for Semi-supervised Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation,"With the increasing need for facial behavior analysis, semi-supervised AU intensity estimation using only keyframe annotations has emerged as a practical and effective solution to relieve the burden of annotation. However, the lack of annotations makes the spurious correlation problem caused by AU co-occurrences and subject variation much more prominent, leading to non-robust intensity estimation that is entangled among AUs and biased among subjects. We observe that trend information inherent in keyframe annotations could act as extra supervision and raising the awareness of AU-specific facial appearance changing trends during training is the key to learning invariant AU-specific features. To this end, we propose Trend-AwareSupervision (TAS), which pursues three kinds of trend awareness, including intra-trend ranking awareness, intra-trend speed awareness, and inter-trend subject awareness. TAS alleviates the spurious correlation problem by raising trend awareness during training to learn AU-specific features that represent the corresponding facial appearance changes, to achieve intensity estimation invariance. Experiments conducted on two commonly used AU benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, show the effectiveness of each kind of awareness. And under trend-aware supervision, the performance can be improved without extra computational or storage costs during inference.","['CMS: Affective Computing', 'CV: Biometrics', 'Face', 'Gesture & Pose']",,"['Yingjie Chen', 'Jiarui Zhang', 'Tao Wang', 'Yun Liang']","['Peking University', 'Peking University', 'Peking University', 'Peking University']",[]
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/27804,Security,Enhancing the Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks with Stochastic Gating Mechanisms,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploit neural spikes to provide solutions for low-power intelligent applications on neuromorphic hardware. Although SNNs have high computational efficiency due to spiking communication, they still lack resistance to adversarial attacks and noise perturbations. In the brain, neuronal responses generally possess stochasticity induced by ion channels and synapses, while the role of stochasticity in computing tasks is poorly understood. Inspired by this, we elaborate a stochastic gating spiking neural model for layer-by-layer spike communication, introducing stochasticity to SNNs. Through theoretical analysis, our gating model can be viewed as a regularizer that prevents error amplification under attacks. Meanwhile, our work can explain the robustness of Poisson coding. Experimental results prove that our method can be used alone or with existing robust enhancement algorithms to improve SNN robustness and reduce SNN energy consumption. We hope our work will shed new light on the role of stochasticity in the computation of SNNs.

Inspired by the role of emotion concepts in visual perception coding within the human brain, we propose a dual-pathway framework emulating the neural computation of emotion recognition. Specifically, these two pathways are designed to model the representation of emotion concepts in the brain and the visual perception process, respectively. For the former, we adopt a disentangled approach to extract emotion concepts from complex facial geometric attributes; for the latter, we employ an emotional confidence evaluation strategy to determine which concept is optimal for regularizing the perceptual coding. The proposed concept-regularized coding strategy endows the framework with flexibility and interpretability as well as good performances on several benchmarking FER datasets.","['CMS: Other Foundations of Cognitive Modeling & Systems', 'CMS: Affective Computing']",,"['Han Lu', 'Xiahai Zhuang', 'Qiang Luo']","['Fudan University', 'Fudan University', 'Fudan University']",[]

However, the utilization of text for diverse music style transfer poses significant challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of matched audio-text datasets. Music, being an abstract and complex art form, exhibits variations and intricacies even within the same genre, thereby making accurate textual descriptions challenging. This paper presents a music style transfer approach that effectively captures musical attributes using minimal data.  We introduce a novel time-varying textual inversion module to precisely capture mel-spectrogram features at different levels. During inference, we utilize a bias-reduced stylization technique to get stable results.

Consequently, there is a lack of development in ToM reasoning tasks within the area of VideoQA. This paper presents BDIQA, the first benchmark to explore the cognitive reasoning capabilities of VideoQA models in the context of ToM. BDIQA is inspired by the cognitive development of children's ToM and addresses the current deficiencies in machine ToM within datasets and tasks. Specifically, it offers tasks at two difficulty levels, assessing Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) reasoning in both simple and complex scenarios.  We conduct evaluations on several mainstream methods of VideoQA and diagnose their capabilities with zero-shot, few-shot and supervised learning.
