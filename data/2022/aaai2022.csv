https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04286,Transparency & Explainability,Proximal PanNet: A Model-Based Deep Network for Pansharpening.,"Recently, deep learning techniques have been extensively studied for pansharpening, which aims to generate a high resolution multispectral (HRMS) image by fusing a low resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. However, existing deep learning-based pansharpening methods directly learn the mapping from LRMS and PAN to HRMS. These network architectures always lack sufficient interpretability, which limits further performance improvements. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep network for pansharpening by combining the model-based methodology with the deep learning method. Firstly, we build an observation model for pansharpening using the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) technique and design a proximal gradient algorithm to solve this model. Secondly, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a deep network, dubbed as Proximal PanNet, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Finally, all the learnable modules can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that our network performs better than other advanced methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",[],[],"['Xiangyong Cao', 'Yang Chen', 'Wenfei Cao']","['', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15629,Transparency & Explainability,Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments.,"Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03210,Transparency & Explainability,Model-Based Image Signal Processors via Learnable Dictionaries.,"Digital cameras transform sensor RAW readings into RGB images by means of their Image Signal Processor (ISP). Computational photography tasks such as image denoising and colour constancy are commonly performed in the RAW domain, in part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing simplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings. Despite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the abundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted to bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted model-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require manual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks require large amounts of training data, at times with complex training procedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control. Towards addressing these existing limitations, we present a novel hybrid model-based and data-driven ISP that builds on canonical ISP operations and is both learnable and interpretable. Our proposed invertible model, capable of bidirectional mapping between RAW and RGB domains, employs end-to-end learning of rich parameter representations, i.e. dictionaries, that are free from direct parametric supervision and additionally enable simple and plausible data augmentation. We evidence the value of our data generation process by extensive experiments under both RAW image reconstruction and RAW image denoising tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in both. Additionally, we show that our ISP can learn meaningful mappings from few data samples, and that denoising models trained with our dictionary-based data augmentation are competitive despite having only few or zero ground-truth labels.",[],[],"['Marcos V.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10698,Transparency & Explainability,Backdoor Attacks on the DNN Interpretation System.,"Interpretability is crucial to understand the inner workings of deep neural networks (DNNs) and many interpretation methods generate saliency maps that highlight parts of the input image that contribute the most to the prediction made by the DNN. In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image only with injected trigger that is invisible to the naked eye while maintaining the prediction accuracy. The attack relies on injecting poisoned data with a trigger into the training data set. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and untargeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluation of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based and gradient-free interpretation methods for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat when deploying deep learning models developed by untrusty sources. Finally, in the Supplement we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users.",[],[],"['Shihong Fang', 'Anna Choromanska']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04895,Transparency & Explainability,Latent Space Explanation by Intervention.,"The success of deep neural nets heavily relies on their ability to encode complex relations between their input and their output. While this property serves to fit the training data well, it also obscures the mechanism that drives prediction. This study aims to reveal hidden concepts by employing an intervention mechanism that shifts the predicted class based on discrete variational autoencoders. An explanatory model then visualizes the encoded information from any hidden layer and its corresponding intervened representation. By the assessment of differences between the original representation and the intervened representation, one can determine the concepts that can alter the class, hence providing interpretability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on CelebA, where we show various visualizations for bias in the data and suggest different interventions to reveal and change bias.",[],[],"['Itai Gat', 'Guy Lorberbom', 'Idan Schwartz', 'Tamir Hazan']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16012,Transparency & Explainability,Learning the Dynamics of Visual Relational Reasoning via Reinforced Path Routing.,"Recently, neural module networks (NMNs) have yielded ongoing success in answering compositional visual questions, especially those involving multi-hop visual and logical reasoning. NMNs decompose the complex question into several sub-tasks using instance-modules from the reasoning paths of that question and then exploit intermediate supervisions to guide answer prediction, thereby improving inference interpretability. However, their performance may be hindered due to sketchy modeling of intermediate supervisions. For instance, (1) a prior assumption that each instance-module refers to only one grounded object yet overlooks other potentially associated grounded objects, impeding full cross-modal alignment learning; (2) IoU-based intermediate supervisions may introduce noise signals as the bounding box overlap issue might guide the model's focus towards irrelevant objects. To address these issues, a novel method, \textbf{\underline{D}}etection-based \textbf{\underline{I}}ntermediate \textbf{\underline{S}}upervision (DIS), is proposed, which adopts a generative detection framework to facilitate multiple grounding supervisions via sequence generation. As such, DIS offers more comprehensive and accurate intermediate supervisions, thereby boosting answer prediction performance. Furthermore, by considering intermediate results, DIS enhances the consistency in answering compositional questions and their sub-questions.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DIS, showcasing both improved accuracy and state-of-the-art reasoning consistency compared to prior approaches.",[],[],"['Yuhang Liu', 'Daowan Peng', 'Wei Wei', 'Yuanyuan Fu', 'Wenfeng Xie', 'Dangyang Chen']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11547,Transparency & Explainability,"Decompose the Sounds and Pixels, Recompose the Events.","In this paper, we propose a framework centering around a novel architecture called the Event Decomposition Recomposition Network (EDRNet) to tackle the Audio-Visual Event (AVE) localization problem in the supervised and weakly supervised settings. AVEs in the real world exhibit common unravelling patterns (termed as Event Progress Checkpoints (EPC)), which humans can perceive through the cooperation of their auditory and visual senses. Unlike earlier methods which attempt to recognize entire event sequences, the EDRNet models EPCs and inter-EPC relationships using stacked temporal convolutions. Based on the postulation that EPC representations are theoretically consistent for an event category, we introduce the State Machine Based Video Fusion, a novel augmentation technique that blends source videos using different EPC template sequences. Additionally, we design a new loss function called the Land-Shore-Sea loss to compactify continuous foreground and background representations. Lastly, to alleviate the issue of confusing events during weak supervision, we propose a prediction stabilization method called Bag to Instance Label Correction. Experiments on the AVE dataset show that our collective framework outperforms the state-of-the-art by a sizable margin.",[],[],"['Varshanth R.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13296,Transparency & Explainability,Social Interpretable Tree for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction.,"Understanding the multiple socially-acceptable future behaviors is an essential task for many vision applications. In this paper, we propose a tree-based method, termed as Social Interpretable Tree (SIT), to address this multi-modal prediction task, where a hand-crafted tree is built depending on the prior information of observed trajectory to model multiple future trajectories. Specifically, a path in the tree from the root to leaf represents an individual possible future trajectory. SIT employs a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, in which the tree is first built by high-order velocity to balance the complexity and coverage of the tree and then optimized greedily to encourage multimodality. Finally, a teacher-forcing refining operation is used to predict the final fine trajectory. Compared with prior methods which leverage implicit latent variables to represent possible future trajectories, the path in the tree can explicitly explain the rough moving behaviors (e.g., go straight and then turn right), and thus provides better interpretability. Despite the hand-crafted tree, the experimental results on ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Interestingly, the experiments show that the raw built tree without training outperforms many prior deep neural network based approaches. Meanwhile, our method presents sufficient flexibility in long-term prediction and different best-of-$K$ predictions.",[],[],"['Liushuai Shi', 'Le Wang', 'Chengjiang Long', 'Sanping Zhou', 'Fang Zheng', 'Nanning Zheng', 'Gang Hua']","['', '', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06197,Transparency & Explainability,Video as Conditional Graph Hierarchy for Multi-Granular Question Answering.,"Video question answering requires the models to understand and reason about both the complex video and language data to correctly derive the answers. Existing efforts have been focused on designing sophisticated cross-modal interactions to fuse the information from two modalities, while encoding the video and question holistically as frame and word sequences. Despite their success, these methods are essentially revolving around the sequential nature of video- and question-contents, providing little insight to the problem of question-answering and lacking interpretability as well. In this work, we argue that while video is presented in frame sequence, the visual elements (e.g., objects, actions, activities and events) are not sequential but rather hierarchical in semantic space. To align with the multi-granular essence of linguistic concepts in language queries, we propose to model video as a conditional graph hierarchy which weaves together visual facts of different granularity in a level-wise manner, with the guidance of corresponding textual cues. Despite the simplicity, our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of such conditional hierarchical graph architecture, with clear performance improvements over prior methods and also better generalization across different type of questions. Further analyses also demonstrate the model's reliability as it shows meaningful visual-textual evidences for the predicted answers.",[],[],"['Junbin Xiao', 'Angela Yao', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Yicong Li', 'Wei Ji', 'Tat-Seng Chua']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14380,Transparency & Explainability,Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization for Unbiased Long-Tailed Classification.,"We address the overlooked unbiasedness in existing long-tailed classification methods: we find that their overall improvement is mostly attributed to the biased preference of tail over head, as the test distribution is assumed to be balanced; however, when the test is as imbalanced as the long-tailed training data -- let the test respect Zipf's law of nature -- the tail bias is no longer beneficial overall because it hurts the head majorities. In this paper, we propose Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization (xERM) for training an unbiased model to achieve strong performances on both test distributions, which empirically demonstrates that xERM fundamentally improves the classification by learning better feature representation rather than the head vs. tail game. Based on causality, we further theoretically explain why xERM achieves unbiasedness: the bias caused by the domain selection is removed by adjusting the empirical risks on the imbalanced domain and the balanced but unseen domain.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11386,Transparency & Explainability,Optimizing Binary Decision Diagrams with MaxSAT for Classification.,"The growing interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for critical decision making motivates the need for interpretable machine learning (ML) models. In fact, due to their structure (especially with small sizes), these models are inherently understandable by humans. Recently, several exact methods for computing such models are proposed to overcome weaknesses of traditional heuristic methods by providing more compact models or better prediction quality. Despite their compressed representation of Boolean functions, Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) did not gain enough interest as other interpretable ML models. In this paper, we first propose SAT-based models for learning optimal BDDs (in terms of the number of features) that classify all input examples. Then, we lift the encoding to a MaxSAT model to learn optimal BDDs in limited depths, that maximize the number of examples correctly classified. Finally, we tackle the fragmentation problem by introducing a method to merge compatible subtrees for the BDDs found via the MaxSAT model. Our empirical study shows clear benefits of the proposed approach in terms of prediction quality and intrepretability (i.e., lighter size) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",[],[],"['Hao Hu', 'Marie-José Huguet', 'Mohamed Siala']","['Zhejiang Lab, Zhejiang University', '', 'Université Libre de Bruxelles']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11527,Transparency & Explainability,Subspace Differential Privacy.,"Many data applications have certain invariant constraints due to practical needs. Data curators who employ differential privacy need to respect such constraints on the sanitized data product as a primary utility requirement. Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees. We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation. We showcase the proposed mechanisms on the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance demonstration data, and a spatio-temporal dataset of mobile access point connections on a large university campus.",[],[],"['Jie Gao', 'Ruobin Gong', 'Fang-Yi Yu']","['', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00225,Transparency & Explainability,STDEN: Towards Physics-Guided Neural Networks for Traffic Flow Prediction.,"High-performance traffic flow prediction model designing, a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, is a long-standing but still challenging task for industrial and academic communities. The lack of integration between physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar applications.",[],[],"['Jiahao Ji', 'Jingyuan Wang', 'Zhe Jiang', 'Jiawei Jiang', 'Hu Zhang']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08025,Transparency & Explainability,TLogic: Temporal Logical Rules for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Knowledge Graphs.,"Conventional static knowledge graphs model entities in relational data as nodes, connected by edges of specific relation types. However, information and knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency. Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods, TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are transferred to related datasets with a common vocabulary.",[],[],"['Yushan Liu', 'Yunpu Ma', 'Marcel Hildebrandt', 'Mitchell Joblin', 'Volker Tresp']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]

Counterfactual explanations can help users understand not only why ML models make certain decisions, but also how these decisions can be changed. We frame the problem of finding counterfactual explanations as a gradient-based optimization task and extend previous work that could only be applied to differentiable models. In order to accommodate non-differentiable models such as tree ensembles, we use probabilistic model approximations in the optimization framework. We introduce an approximation technique that is effective for finding counterfactual explanations for predictions of the original model and show that our counterfactual examples are significantly closer to the original instances than those produced by other methods specifically designed for tree ensembles.",[],[],"['Ana Lucic', 'Harrie Oosterhuis', 'Hinda Haned', 'Maarten de Rijke']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01155,Transparency & Explainability,DeepVisualInsight: Time-Travelling Visualization for Spatio-Temporal Causality of Deep Classification Training.,"Understanding how the predictions of deep learning models are formed during the training process is crucial to improve model performance and fix model defects, especially when we need to investigate nontrivial training strategies such as active learning, and track the root cause of unexpected training results such as performance degeneration. In this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight (DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep learning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case study shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of various training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool for analyzing deep learning training processes.",[],[],"['Xianglin Yang', 'Yun Lin', 'Ruofan Liu', 'Zhenfeng He', 'Chao Wang', 'Jin Song Dong', 'Hong Mei']","['', '', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05276,Transparency & Explainability,Trading Complexity for Sparsity in Random Forest Explanations.,"Random forests have long been considered as powerful model ensembles in machine learning. By training multiple decision trees, whose diversity is fostered through data and feature subsampling, the resulting random forest can lead to more stable and reliable predictions than a single decision tree. This however comes at the cost of decreased interpretability: while decision trees are often easily interpretable, the predictions made by random forests are much more difficult to understand, as they involve a majority vote over hundreds of decision trees. In this paper, we examine different types of reasons that explain ""why"" an input instance is classified as positive or negative by a Boolean random forest. Notably, as an alternative to sufficient reasons taking the form of prime implicants of the random forest, we introduce majoritary reasons which are prime implicants of a strict majority of decision trees. For these different abductive explanations, the tractability of the generation problem (finding one reason) and the minimization problem (finding one shortest reason) are investigated. Experiments conducted on various datasets reveal the existence of a trade-off between runtime complexity and sparsity. Sufficient reasons - for which the identification problem is DP-complete - are slightly larger than majoritary reasons that can be generated using a simple linear- time greedy algorithm, and significantly larger than minimal majoritary reasons that can be approached using an anytime P ARTIAL M AX SAT algorithm.",[],[],"['Gilles Audemard', 'Steve Bellart', 'Louenas Bounia', 'Frédéric Koriche', 'Jean-Marie Lagniez', 'Pierre Marquis']","['', '', '', '', 'CRIL, CNRS, Université d’Artois, Lens, France', '']",[]

In particular, we propose a fine-grained reasoning framework by following the human information-processing model, introduce a mutual-reinforcement-based method for incorporating human knowledge about which evidence is more important, and design a prior-aware bi-channel kernel graph network to model subtle differences between pieces of evidence.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06804,Transparency & Explainability,Entropy-Based Logic Explanations of Neural Networks.,"Explainable artificial intelligence has rapidly emerged since lawmakers have started requiring interpretable models for safety-critical domains. Concept-based neural networks have arisen as explainable-by-design methods as they leverage human-understandable symbols (i.e. concepts) to predict class memberships. However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of First-Order Logic. The method relies on an entropy-based criterion which automatically identifies the most relevant concepts. We consider four different case studies to demonstrate that: (i) this entropy-based criterion enables the distillation of concise logic explanations in safety-critical domains from clinical data to computer vision; (ii) the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art white-box models in terms of classification accuracy and matches black box performances.",[],[],"['Pietro Barbiero', 'Gabriele Ciravegna', 'Francesco Giannini', 'Pietro Lió', 'Marco Gori', 'Stefano Melacci']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]

We propose to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandits.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00411,Transparency & Explainability,Disentangled Spatiotemporal Graph Generative Models.,"Spatiotemporal graph represents a crucial data structure where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space and can evolve dynamically over time. Nowadays, spatiotemporal graph data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from microscale (e.g. protein folding), to middle-scale (e.g. dynamic functional connectivity), to macro-scale (e.g. human mobility network). Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among spatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in network science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by human knowledge. This usually fit well towards the graph properties which can be predefined, but cannot do well for the most cases, especially for many key domains where the human has yet very limited knowledge such as protein folding and biological neuronal networks. In this paper, we aim at pushing forward the modeling and understanding of spatiotemporal graphs via new disentangled deep generative models. Specifically, a new Bayesian model is proposed that factorizes spatiotemporal graphs into spatial, temporal, and graph factors as well as the factors that explain the interplay among them. A variational objective function and new mutual information thresholding algorithms driven by information bottleneck theory have been proposed to maximize the disentanglement among the factors with theoretical guarantees.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00491,Transparency & Explainability,KerGNNs: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks with Graph Kernels.,"Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph classification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models.",[],[],"['Aosong Feng', 'Chenyu You', 'Shiqiang Wang', 'Leandros Tassiulas']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07493,Transparency & Explainability,Algorithmic Concept-Based Explainable Reasoning.,"Recent research on graph neural network (GNN) models successfully applied GNNs to classical graph algorithms and combinatorial optimisation problems. This has numerous benefits, such as allowing applications of algorithms when preconditions are not satisfied, or reusing learned models when sufficient training data is not available or can't be generated. Unfortunately, a key hindrance of these approaches is their lack of explainability, since GNNs are black-box models that cannot be interpreted directly. In this work, we address this limitation by applying existing work on concept-based explanations to GNN models. We introduce concept-bottleneck GNNs, which rely on a modification to the GNN readout mechanism. Using three case studies we demonstrate that: (i) our proposed model is capable of accurately learning concepts and extracting propositional formulas based on the learned concepts for each target class; (ii) our concept-based GNN models achieve comparative performance with state-of-the-art models; (iii) we can derive global graph concepts, without explicitly providing any supervision on graph-level concepts.",[],[],"['Dobrik Georgiev', 'Pietro Barbiero', 'Dmitry Kazhdan', 'Petar Veličković', 'Pietro Liò']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15745,Transparency & Explainability,Reinforcement Learning of Causal Variables Using Mediation Analysis.,"Many open problems in machine learning are intrinsically related to causality, however, the use of causal analysis in machine learning is still in its early stage. Within a general reinforcement learning setting, we consider the problem of building a general reinforcement learning agent which uses experience to construct a causal graph of the environment, and use this graph to inform its policy. Our approach has three characteristics: First, we learn a simple, coarse-grained causal graph, in which the variables reflect states at many time instances, and the interventions happen at the level of policies, rather than individual actions. Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain an optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal variables. Thirdly, our approach relies on estimating conditional expectations rather the familiar expected return from reinforcement learning, and we therefore apply a generalization of Bellman's equations. We show the method can learn a plausible causal graph in a grid-world environment, and the agent obtains an improvement in performance when using the causally informed policy. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply causal analysis in a reinforcement learning setting without strict restrictions on the number of states. We have observed that mediation analysis provides a promising avenue for transforming the problem of causal acquisition into one of cost-function minimization, but importantly one which involves estimating conditional expectations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06124,Transparency & Explainability,Causal Discovery in Hawkes Processes by Minimum Description Length.,"Hawkes processes are a special class of temporal point processes which exhibit a natural notion of causality, as occurrence of events in the past may increase the probability of events in the future. Discovery of the underlying influence network among the dimensions of multi-dimensional temporal processes is of high importance in disciplines where a high-frequency data is to model, e.g. in financial data or in seismological data. This paper approaches the problem of learning Granger-causal network in multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. We formulate this problem as a model selection task in which we follow the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for MDL-based inference using a Monte-Carlo method and we use it for our causal discovery problem. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on synthetic and real-world financial data. The synthetic experiments demonstrate superiority of our method incausal graph discovery compared to the baseline methods with respect to the size of the data.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09744,Transparency & Explainability,Covered Information Disentanglement: Model Transparency via Unbiased Permutation Importance.,"Model transparency is a prerequisite in many domains and an increasingly popular area in machine learning research. In the medical domain, for instance, unveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the diagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and research directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global predictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted data is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other related approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence of covariates since these cover part of its provided information. To address this issue, we propose Covered Information Disentanglement (CID), a method that considers all feature information overlap to correct the values provided by permutation importance. We further show how to compute CID efficiently when coupled with Markov random fields. We demonstrate its efficacy in adjusting permutation importance first on a controlled toy dataset and discuss its effect on real-world medical data.",[],[],"['João Pereira', 'Erik S.G.

Initially consisting of unsupervised models with independence assumptions, more recently, weak supervision and correlated features have been explored, but without a causal view of the generative process. In contrast, we work under the regime of a causal generative process where generative factors are either independent or can be potentially confounded by a set of observed or unobserved confounders. We present an analysis of disentangled representations through the notion of disentangled causal process. We motivate the need for new metrics and datasets to study causal disentanglement and propose two evaluation metrics and a dataset. We show that our metrics capture the desiderata of disentangled causal process.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00911,Transparency & Explainability,ProtGNN: Towards Self-Explaining Graph Neural Networks.,"Despite the recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it remains challenging to explain the predictions made by GNNs. Existing explanation methods mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another explanatory model is employed to provide explanations for a trained GNN. The fact that post-hoc methods fail to reveal the original reasoning process of GNNs raises the need of building GNNs with built-in interpretability. In this work, we propose Prototype Graph Neural Network (ProtGNN), which combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs. In ProtGNN, the explanations are naturally derived from the case-based reasoning process and are actually used during classification. The prediction of ProtGNN is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few learned prototypes in the latent space. Furthermore, for better interpretability and higher efficiency, a novel conditional subgraph sampling module is incorporated to indicate which part of the input graph is most similar to each prototype in ProtGNN+. Finally, we evaluate our method on a wide range of datasets and perform concrete case studies. Extensive results show that ProtGNN and ProtGNN+ can provide inherent interpretability while achieving accuracy on par with the non-interpretable counterparts.",[],[],"['Zaixi Zhang', 'Qi Liu', 'Hao Wang', 'Chengqiang Lu', 'Cheekong Lee']","['', '', 'Purdue University', '', '']",[]

The challenge is that we have to discover in an unsupervised manner a set of concepts, i.e., A, B and C, that is useful for the explaining the classifier. We first introduce a structural generative model that is suitable to express and discover such concepts. We then propose a learning process that simultaneously learns the data distribution and encourages certain concepts to have a large causal influence on the classifier output.

However, finding statistically significant high-order interactions is challenging due to the intrinsic high dimensionality of the combinatorial effects. Another problem in data-driven modeling is the effect of ""cherry-picking"" a.k.a. selection bias. Our main contribution is to extend the recently developed parametric programming approach for selective inference to high-order interaction models.

Most existing neural models make predictions without giving clues about which part of a false claim goes wrong. In this paper, we propose LOREN, an approach for interpretable fact verification. We decompose the verification of the whole claim at phrase-level, where the veracity of the phrases serves as explanations and can be aggregated into the final verdict according to logical rules. The key insight of LOREN is to represent claim phrase veracity as three-valued latent variables, which are regularized by aggregation logical rules. The final claim verification is based on all latent variables. Thus, LOREN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability -- it is easy to explain how it reaches certain results with claim phrase veracity. Experiments on a public fact verification benchmark show that LOREN is competitive against previous approaches while enjoying the merit of faithful and accurate interpretability.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08219,Transparency & Explainability,Flexible Instance-Specific Rationalization of NLP Models.,"Recent research on model interpretability in natural language processing extensively uses feature scoring methods for identifying which parts of the input are the most important for a model to make a prediction (i.e. explanation or rationale). However, previous research has shown that there is no clear best scoring method across various text classification tasks while practitioners typically have to make several other ad-hoc choices regarding the length and the type of the rationale (e.g. short or long, contiguous or not). Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective and flexible method that allows selecting optimally for each data instance: (1) a feature scoring method; (2) the length; and (3) the type of the rationale. Our method is inspired by input erasure approaches to interpretability which assume that the most faithful rationale for a prediction should be the one with the highest difference between the model's output distribution using the full text and the text after removing the rationale as input respectively. Evaluation on four standard text classification datasets shows that our proposed method provides more faithful, comprehensive and highly sufficient explanations compared to using a fixed feature scoring method, rationale length and type. More importantly, we demonstrate that a practitioner is not required to make any ad-hoc choices in order to extract faithful rationales using our approach.",[],[],"['George Chrysostomou', 'Nikolaos Aletras']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10424,Transparency & Explainability,Unifying Model Explainability and Robustness for Joint Text Classification and Rationale Extraction.,"Recent works have shown explainability and robustness are two crucial ingredients of trustworthy and reliable text classification. However, previous works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales for explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively, a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end, we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC. It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information. Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the attack success rate effectively by up to 69%.

However, as with other high-stakes decision making areas, the requirement for interpretability is of crucial importance. Current models utilized by legal practitioners are more of the conventional machine learning type, wherein they are inherently interpretable, yet unable to harness the performance capabilities of data-driven deep learning models. In this work, we utilize deep learning models in the area of trademark law to shed light on the issue of likelihood of confusion between trademarks. Specifically, we introduce a model-agnostic interpretable intermediate layer, a technique which proves to be effective for legal documents. Furthermore, we utilize weakly supervised learning by means of a curriculum learning strategy, effectively demonstrating the improved performance of a deep learning model. This is in contrast to the conventional models which are only able to utilize the limited number of expensive manually-annotated samples by legal experts.

For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models' prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality.

However translation of deep learning into clinical practice has been hindered by issues such as lack of the transparency and interpretability in these ""black box"" algorithms compared to traditional statistical methods. Specifically, many clinical deep learning models lack rigorous and robust techniques for conveying certainty (or lack thereof) in their predictions -- ultimately limiting their appeal for extensive use in medical decision-making. Furthermore, numerous demonstrations of algorithmic bias have increased hesitancy towards deployment of deep learning for clinical applications. To this end, we explore how conformal predictions can complement existing deep learning approaches by providing an intuitive way of expressing uncertainty while facilitating greater transparency to clinical users. In this paper, we conduct field interviews with radiologists to assess possible use-cases for conformal predictors. Using insights gathered from these interviews, we devise two clinical use-cases and empirically evaluate several methods of conformal predictions on a dermatology photography dataset for skin lesion classification. We show how to modify conformal predictions to be more adaptive to subgroup differences in patient skin tones through equalized coverage.

It provides different types of rules that explain the forecast of the global model and the counterfactual rules, which provide actionable insights for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given instances.

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system. It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models. However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models without requiring a huge amount of parameters.

Machine Learning (ML) models trained with the available data, which is limited in quantity and poor in diversity, will often be biased and inaccurate. At the same time, ML algorithms designed to fight pandemics must have good performance and be developed in a time-sensitive manner.

Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games reformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's optimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be effective, but often get trapped in low-quality solutions when followers' objectives are non-linear or non-quadratic. Moreover, these approaches assume a unique equilibrium or a specific equilibrium concept, e.g., optimistic or pessimistic, which is a limiting assumption in many situations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a stochastic gradient descent--based approach, where the leader's strategy is updated by differentiating through the followers' best responses. We frame the leader's optimization as a learning problem against followers' equilibrium, which allows us to decouple the followers' equilibrium constraints from the leader's problem. This approach also addresses cases with multiple equilibria and arbitrary equilibrium selection procedures by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium. To this end, this paper introduces a novel concept called equilibrium flow to formally characterize the set of equilibrium selection processes where the gradient with respect to a sampled equilibrium is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient. We evaluate our approach experimentally against existing baselines in three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers and find that in each case, our approach is able to achieve higher utility for the leader.",[],[],"['Kai Wang', 'Lily Xu', 'Andrew Perrault', 'Michael K.

Although this procedure is well-defined and solved for planar images, it is not easy for spherical image object detection.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10943,Fairness & Bias,Gradient Based Activations for Accurate Bias-Free Learning.,"Bias mitigation in machine learning models is imperative, yet challenging. While several approaches have been proposed, one view towards mitigating bias is through adversarial learning. A discriminator is used to identify the bias attributes such as gender, age or race in question. This discriminator is used adversarially to ensure that it cannot distinguish the bias attributes. The main drawback in such a model is that it directly introduces a trade-off with accuracy as the features that the discriminator deems to be sensitive for discrimination of bias could be correlated with classification. In this work we solve the problem. We show that a biased discriminator can actually be used to improve this bias-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, this is achieved by using a feature masking approach using the discriminator's gradients. We ensure that the features favoured for the bias discrimination are de-emphasized and the unbiased features are enhanced during classification. We show that this simple approach works well to reduce bias as well as improve accuracy significantly. We evaluate the proposed model on standard benchmarks.

Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves, which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.",[],[],"['Shenwang Jiang', 'Jianan Li', 'Ying Wang', 'Bo Huang', 'Zhang Zhang', 'Tingfa Xu']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04392,Fairness & Bias,Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging.,"Deep learning has the potential to automate many clinically useful tasks in medical imaging. However translation of deep learning into clinical practice has been hindered by issues such as lack of the transparency and interpretability in these ""black box"" algorithms compared to traditional statistical methods. Specifically, many clinical deep learning models lack rigorous and robust techniques for conveying certainty (or lack thereof) in their predictions -- ultimately limiting their appeal for extensive use in medical decision-making. Furthermore, numerous demonstrations of algorithmic bias have increased hesitancy towards deployment of deep learning for clinical applications. To this end, we explore how conformal predictions can complement existing deep learning approaches by providing an intuitive way of expressing uncertainty while facilitating greater transparency to clinical users. In this paper, we conduct field interviews with radiologists to assess possible use-cases for conformal predictors. Using insights gathered from these interviews, we devise two clinical use-cases and empirically evaluate several methods of conformal predictions on a dermatology photography dataset for skin lesion classification. We show how to modify conformal predictions to be more adaptive to subgroup differences in patient skin tones through equalized coverage. Finally, we compare conformal prediction against measures of epistemic uncertainty.",[],[],"['Charles Lu', 'Andreanne Lemay', 'Ken Chang', 'Katharina Hoebel', 'Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]

While existing work shows promising results in image classification, probability calibration has not been much explored for personalized ranking. In this paper, we aim to estimate the calibrated probability of how likely a user will prefer an item. We investigate various parametric distributions and propose two parametric calibration methods, namely Gaussian calibration and Gamma calibration. Each proposed method can be seen as a post-processing function that maps the ranking scores of pre-trained models to well-calibrated preference probabilities, without affecting the recommendation performance. We also design the unbiased empirical risk minimization framework that guides the calibration methods to learning of true preference probability from the biased user-item interaction dataset. Extensive evaluations with various personalized ranking models on real-world datasets show that both the proposed calibration methods and the unbiased empirical risk minimization significantly improve the calibration performance.",[],[],"['Wonbin Kweon', 'SeongKu Kang', 'Hwanjo Yu']","['', '', '']",[]

We refer to this as introduced unfairness, and investigate the conditions under which it may arise. To this end, we propose introduced total variation as a measure of introduced unfairness, and establish graphical conditions under which it may be incentivised to occur. These criteria imply that adding the sensitive attribute as a feature removes the incentive for introduced variation under well-behaved loss functions.

While prior work studies the effects of model accuracy on humans, we endeavour here to investigate the complex dynamics of how both a model's predictive performance and bias may transfer to humans in a recommendation-aided decision task. We consider the domain of ML-assisted hiring, where humans -- operating in a constrained selection setting -- can choose whether they wish to utilize a trained model's inferences to help select candidates from written biographies. We conduct a large-scale user study leveraging a re-created dataset of real bios from prior work, where humans predict the ground truth occupation of given candidates with and without the help of three different NLP classifiers (random, bag-of-words, and deep neural network). Our results demonstrate that while high-performance models significantly improve human performance in a hybrid setting, some models mitigate hybrid bias while others accentuate it. We examine these findings through the lens of decision conformity and observe that our model architecture choices have an impact on human-AI conformity and bias, motivating the explicit need to assess these complex dynamics prior to deployment.",[],[],"['Andi Peng', 'Besmira Nushi', 'Emre Kiciman', 'Kori Inkpen', 'Ece Kamar']","['', 'Microsoft Research', '', '', 'Microsoft Research']",[]

We study how to recommend an item at each step to maximize the expected reward while achieving user-side fairness for customers, i.e., customers who share similar profiles will receive a similar reward regardless of their sensitive attributes and items being recommended. By incorporating causal inference into bandits and adopting soft intervention to model the arm selection strategy, we first propose the d-separation based UCB algorithm (D-UCB) to explore the utilization of the d-separation set in reducing the amount of exploration needed to achieve low cumulative regret. Based on that, we then propose the fair causal bandit (F-UCB) for achieving the counterfactual individual fairness.

In this paper, we move forward to refine novel-class features by finetuning a trained deep network. Finetuning is designed to focus on reducing biases in novel-class feature distributions, which we define as two aspects: class-agnostic and class-specific biases. Class-agnostic bias is defined as the distribution shifting introduced by domain difference, which we propose Distribution Calibration Module(DCM) to reduce. DCM owes good property of eliminating domain difference and fast feature adaptation during optimization. Class-specific bias is defined as the biased estimation using a few samples in novel classes, which we propose Selected Sampling(SS) to reduce. Without inferring the actual class distribution, SS is designed by running sampling using proposal distributions around support-set samples. By powering finetuning with DCM and SS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Meta-Dataset with consistent performance boosts over ten datasets from different domains. We believe our simple yet effective method demonstrates its possibility to be applied on practical few-shot applications.",[],[],"['Ran Tao', 'Han Zhang', 'Yutong Zheng', 'Marios Savvides']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09447,Fairness & Bias,Algorithmic Fairness Verification with Graphical Models.,"In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been deployed in safety-critical and high-stake decision-making, where the fairness of algorithms is of paramount importance. Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling. In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers. We also demonstrate that FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence functions as a stepping stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets of features.",[],[],"['Bishwamittra Ghosh', 'Debabrota Basu', 'Kuldeep S.

Yet this would be a much needed feature for practical applications. In this paper, we propose an approach which learns a hyper-policy, whose input is time, that outputs the parameters of the policy to be queried at that time. This hyper-policy is trained to maximize the estimated future performance, efficiently reusing past data by means of importance sampling, at the cost of introducing a controlled bias. We combine the future performance estimate with the past performance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. To avoid overfitting the collected data, we derive a differentiable variance bound that we embed as a penalization term.

Here we consider fairness in longitudinal right-censored environments, where the time to event might be unknown, resulting in censorship of the class label and inapplicability of existing fairness studies. We devise applicable fairness measures, propose a debiasing algorithm, and provide necessary theoretical constructs to bridge fairness with and without censorship for these important and socially-sensitive tasks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03281,Fairness & Bias,Personalized Public Policy Analysis in Social Sciences Using Causal-Graphical Normalizing Flows.,"Structural Equation/Causal Models (SEMs/SCMs) are widely used in epidemiology and social sciences to identify and analyze the average causal effect (ACE) and conditional ACE (CACE). Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE. However, much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used for counterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public Policy Analysis (P$^3$A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalized medicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relatively closed systems), P$^3$A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it for open social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactual inference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitating P$^3$A. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making any assumption about functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantization trick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizing flows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performs on-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE, when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown. Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs, demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like other traditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFs will likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitating P$^3$A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current `one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.",[],[],"['Sourabh Balgi', 'Jose M.

In this article, we propose an approach for identifying gender and racial stereotypes in word embeddings trained on judicial opinions from U.S. case law. Embeddings containing stereotype information may cause harm when used by downstream systems for classification, information extraction, question answering, or other machine learning systems used to build legal research tools. We first explain how previously proposed methods for identifying these biases are not well suited for use with word embeddings trained on legal opinion text. We then propose a domain adapted method for identifying gender and racial biases in the legal domain. Our analyses using these methods suggest that racial and gender biases are encoded into word embeddings trained on legal opinions. These biases are not mitigated by exclusion of historical data, and appear across multiple large topical areas of the law. Implications for downstream systems that use legal opinion word embeddings and suggestions for potential mitigation strategies based on our observations are also discussed.",[],[],"['Sean Matthews', 'John Hudzina', 'Dawn Sepehr']","['', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03183,Fairness & Bias,Modification-Fair Cluster Editing.,"The classic Cluster Editing problem (also known as Correlation Clustering) asks to transform a given graph into a disjoint union of cliques (clusters) by a small number of edge modifications. When applied to vertex-colored graphs (the colors representing subgroups), standard algorithms for the NP-hard Cluster Editing problem may yield solutions that are biased towards subgroups of data (e.g., demographic groups), measured in the number of modifications incident to the members of the subgroups. We propose a modification fairness constraint which ensures that the number of edits incident to each subgroup is proportional to its size. To start with, we study Modification-Fair Cluster Editing for graphs with two vertex colors. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if one may only insert edges within a subgroup; note that in the classic ""non-fair"" setting, this case is trivially polynomial-time solvable. However, in the more general editing form, the modification-fair variant remains fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of edge edits. We complement these and further theoretical results with an empirical analysis of our model on real-world social networks where we find that the price of modification-fairness is surprisingly low, that is, the cost of optimal modification-fair solutions differs from the cost of optimal ""non-fair"" solutions only by a small percentage.",[],[],"['Vincent Froese', 'Leon Kellerhals', 'Rolf Niedermeier']","['', '', '']",[]

In this paper, we refer to the prime implicates of a complete reason as necessary reasons for the decision. We justify this terminology semantically and show that necessary reasons correspond to what is known as contrastive explanations. We also study the computation of complete reasons for multi-class decision trees and graphs with nominal and numeric features for which we derive efficient, closed-form complete reasons. We further investigate the computation of shortest necessary and sufficient reasons for a broad class of complete reasons, which include the derived closed forms and the complete reasons for Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs).

Here, we develop a simple, effective and general method, CrossWalk, that enhances fairness of various graph algorithms, including influence maximization, link prediction and node classification, applied to node embeddings. CrossWalk is applicable to any random walk based node representation learning algorithm, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec. The key idea is to bias random walks to cross group boundaries, by upweighting edges which (1) are closer to the groups' peripheries or (2) connect different groups in the network. CrossWalk pulls nodes that are near groups' peripheries towards their neighbors from other groups in the embedding space, while preserving the necessary structural properties of the graph.

An explanatory model then visualizes the encoded information from any hidden layer and its corresponding intervened representation.

Backpropagation is not directly applicable, nor are the reparameterization tricks used in networks with continuous stochastic variables. To address this challenge, we present Hindsight Network Credit Assignment (HNCA), a novel gradient estimation algorithm for networks of discrete stochastic units. HNCA works by assigning credit to each unit based on the degree to which its output influences its immediate children in the network. We prove that HNCA produces unbiased gradient estimates with reduced variance compared to the REINFORCE estimator, while the computational cost is similar to that of backpropagation. We first apply HNCA in a contextual bandit setting to optimize a reward function that is unknown to the agent. In this setting, we empirically demonstrate that HNCA significantly outperforms REINFORCE, indicating that the variance reduction implied by our theoretical analysis is significant and impactful. We then show how HNCA can be extended to optimize a more general function of the outputs of a network of stochastic units, where the function is known to the agent. We apply this extended version of HNCA to train a discrete variational auto-encoder and empirically show it compares favourably to other strong methods. We believe that the ideas underlying HNCA can help stimulate new ways of thinking about efficient credit assignment in stochastic compute graphs.",[],[],['Kenny Young'],[''],[]

In practice, data can have missing values, and data missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead to an unfair model.

Previous debiasing methods focus mainly on modeling bias and only implicitly consider semantic information while completely overlooking the complex underlying causal structure among bias and semantic components. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology that leverages a causal inference framework to effectively remove gender bias.

In this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage problems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However, converted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule. Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN eliminates data and class leakage issues with a slight performance drop (less than ~2) and significant energy-efficiency gain (about 55x) compared to the standard ANN. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of privacy-preserving SNN training.",[],[],"['Youngeun Kim', 'Yeshwanth Venkatesha', 'Priyadarshini Panda']","['', '', '']",[]

Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees. We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation.

In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, we delicately design a novel search space and propose a DP-aware method for training candidate models.

This is motivated by the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world sequential decision making problems, where protecting users' sensitive and private information is becoming paramount. We consider two variants of DP -- joint DP (JDP), where a centralized agent is responsible for protecting users' sensitive data and local DP (LDP), where information needs to be protected directly on the user side. We first propose two general frameworks -- one for policy optimization and another for value iteration -- for designing private, optimistic RL algorithms. We then instantiate these frameworks with suitable privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, and simultaneously obtain sublinear regret guarantees. The regret bounds show that under JDP, the cost of privacy is only a lower order additive term, while for a stronger privacy protection under LDP, the cost suffered is multiplicative. Finally, the regret bounds are obtained by a unified analysis, which, we believe, can be extended beyond tabular MDPs.",[],[],"['Sayak Ray Chowdhury', 'Xingyu Zhou']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08266,Privacy & Data Governance,Hard to Forget: Poisoning Attacks on Certified Machine Unlearning.,"The right to erasure requires removal of a user's information from data held by organizations, with rigorous interpretations extending to downstream products such as learned models. Retraining from scratch with the particular user's data omitted fully removes its influence on the resulting model, but comes with a high computational cost. Machine ""unlearning"" mitigates the cost incurred by full retraining: instead, models are updated incrementally, possibly only requiring retraining when approximation errors accumulate. Rapid progress has been made towards privacy guarantees on the indistinguishability of unlearned and retrained models, but current formalisms do not place practical bounds on computation. In this paper we demonstrate how an attacker can exploit this oversight, highlighting a novel attack surface introduced by machine unlearning. We consider an attacker aiming to increase the computational cost of data removal. We derive and empirically investigate a poisoning attack on certified machine unlearning where strategically designed training data triggers complete retraining when removed.",[],[],"['Neil G.

To this end, we i) show that standard composition tools outperform more advanced techniques in many settings, ii) empirically and theoretically demonstrate an intrinsic connection between the learning rate and clipping norm hyperparameters, iii) show that adaptive optimizers like DPAdam enjoy a significant advantage in the process of honest hyperparameter tuning, and iv) draw upon novel limiting behaviour of Adam in the DP setting to design a new and more efficient optimizer.",[],[],"['Shubhankar Mohapatra', 'Sajin Sasy', 'Xi He', 'Gautam Kamath', 'Om Thakkar']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05495,Privacy & Data Governance,How Private Is Your RL Policy? An Inverse RL Based Analysis Framework.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn how to perform various tasks from scratch. In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems, and more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the policies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing differentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as Value Iteration, Deep Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We propose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL (PRIL) analysis framework, that performs reward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the agents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack, wherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using an Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed, we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. We do so by quantifying the extent to which each private policy protects the reward function by measuring distances between the original and reconstructed rewards.",[],[],"['Kritika Prakash', 'Fiza Husain', 'Praveen Paruchuri', 'Sujit P.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12088,Privacy & Data Governance,SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning.,"Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two popular distributed machine learning approaches. Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures is further evaluated under extended experimental settings.",[],[],"['Chandra Thapa', 'M.A.P.

Distributing synthetic data as rewards (instead of trained models or money) offers task- and model-agnostic benefits for downstream learning tasks and is less likely to violate data privacy regulation. To realize the framework, we firstly propose a data valuation function using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) that values data based on its quantity and quality in terms of its closeness to the true data distribution and provide theoretical results guiding the kernel choice in our MMD-based data valuation function. Then, we formulate the reward scheme as a linear optimization problem that when solved, guarantees certain incentives such as fairness in the CGM framework. We devise a weighted sampling algorithm for generating synthetic data to be distributed to each party as reward such that the value of its data and the synthetic data combined matches its assigned reward value by the reward scheme. We empirically show using simulated and real-world datasets that the parties' synthetic data rewards are commensurate to their contributions.",[],[],"['Sebastian Shenghong Tay', 'Xinyi Xu', 'Chuan Sheng Foo', 'Bryan Kian Hsiang Low']","['', '', '', '']",[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03223,Security,Context-Aware Transfer Attacks for Object Detection.,"Blackbox transfer attacks for image classifiers have been extensively studied in recent years. In contrast, little progress has been made on transfer attacks for object detectors. Object detectors take a holistic view of the image and the detection of one object (or lack thereof) often depends on other objects in the scene. This makes such detectors inherently context-aware and adversarial attacks in this space are more challenging than those targeting image classifiers. In this paper, we present a new approach to generate context-aware attacks for object detectors. We show that by using co-occurrence of objects and their relative locations and sizes as context information, we can successfully generate targeted mis-categorization attacks that achieve higher transfer success rates on blackbox object detectors than the state-of-the-art. We test our approach on a variety of object detectors with images from PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets and demonstrate up to $20$ percentage points improvement in performance compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.",[],[],"['Zikui Cai', 'Xinxin Xie', 'Shasha Li', 'Mingjun Yin', 'Chengyu Song', 'Srikanth V.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15629,Security,Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments.,"Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10698,Security,Backdoor Attacks on the DNN Interpretation System.,"Interpretability is crucial to understand the inner workings of deep neural networks (DNNs) and many interpretation methods generate saliency maps that highlight parts of the input image that contribute the most to the prediction made by the DNN. In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image only with injected trigger that is invisible to the naked eye while maintaining the prediction accuracy. The attack relies on injecting poisoned data with a trigger into the training data set. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and untargeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluation of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based and gradient-free interpretation methods for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat when deploying deep learning models developed by untrusty sources. Finally, in the Supplement we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users.",[],[],"['Shihong Fang', 'Anna Choromanska']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06658,Security,Learning to Learn Transferable Attack.,"Transfer adversarial attack is a non-trivial black-box adversarial attack that aims to craft adversarial perturbations on the surrogate model and then apply such perturbations to the victim model. However, the transferability of perturbations from existing methods is still limited, since the adversarial perturbations are easily overfitting with a single surrogate model and specific data pattern. In this paper, we propose a Learning to Learn Transferable Attack (LLTA) method, which makes the adversarial perturbations more generalized via learning from both data and model augmentation. For data augmentation, we adopt simple random resizing and padding. For model augmentation, we randomly alter the back propagation instead of the forward propagation to eliminate the effect on the model prediction. By treating the attack of both specific data and a modified model as a task, we expect the adversarial perturbations to adopt enough tasks for generalization. To this end, the meta-learning algorithm is further introduced during the iteration of perturbation generation. Empirical results on the widely-used dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method with a 12.85% higher success rate of transfer attack compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

A recent class of methods to address this problem uses various ways to construct a new training sample by mixing a pair (or more) of training samples. We propose PatchUp, a hidden state block-level regularization technique for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that is applied on selected contiguous blocks of feature maps from a random pair of samples. Our approach improves the robustness of CNN models against the manifold intrusion problem that may occur in other state-of-the-art mixing approaches. Moreover, since we are mixing the contiguous block of features in the hidden space, which has more dimensions than the input space, we obtain more diverse samples for training towards different dimensions. Our experiments on CIFAR10/100, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet using ResNet architectures including PreActResnet18/34, WRN-28-10, ResNet101/152 models show that PatchUp improves upon, or equals, the performance of current state-of-the-art regularizers for CNNs.

Existing approaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under high-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information is coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process struggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework to exploit both the RGB and fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained decomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in the frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with self-enhancement and mutual-enhancement modules. The self-enhancement module captures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise enhancement and channel attention. The Mutual-enhancement module concurrently enhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial dimension. The progressive enhancement process facilitates the learning of discriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues.

To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by multiple deepfake models while achieving a better performance than existing methods.",[],[],"['Hao Huang', 'Yongtao Wang', 'Zhaoyu Chen', 'Yuze Zhang', 'Yuheng Li', 'Zhi Tang', 'Wei Chu', 'Jingdong Chen', 'Weisi Lin', 'Kai-Kuang Ma']","['', 'Alibaba Group', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",[]

In this work, we generate adversarial examples and then train the robust models for event-based data, for the first time. Our algorithm shifts the time of the original events and generates additional adversarial events. Additional adversarial events are generated in two stages. First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack.

Most methods along this line rely on a predefined single-LR-single-HR mapping, which is not flexible enough for the SISR task. Also, GAN-generated fake details may often undermine the realism of the whole image. We address these issues by proposing best-buddy GANs (Beby-GAN) for rich-detail SISR. Relaxing the immutable one-to-one constraint, we allow the estimated patches to dynamically seek the best supervision during training, which is beneficial to producing more reasonable details.

T2L is a challenging task and existing end-to-end works depend on the attention mechanism and autoregressive (AR) decoding manner. However, the AR decoding manner generates current lip frame conditioned on frames generated previously, which inherently hinders the inference speed, and also has a detrimental effect on the quality of generated lip frames due to error propagation. This encourages the research of parallel T2L generation. In this work, we propose a parallel decoding model for fast and high-fidelity text-to-lip generation (ParaLip). Specifically, we predict the duration of the encoded linguistic features and model the target lip frames conditioned on the encoded linguistic features with their duration in a non-autoregressive manner.

Recently, multifarious techniques have been explored, such as domain generalization and representation disentanglement. However, the improvement is still limited by two issues: 1) It is difficult to perfectly map all faces to a shared feature space. If faces from unknown domains are not mapped to the known region in the shared feature space, accidentally inaccurate predictions will be obtained. 2) It is hard to completely consider various spoof traces for disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification framework to alleviate the two issues. Above all, feature generation networks which generate hypotheses of real faces and known attacks are introduced for the first time in the FAS task. Subsequently, two hypothesis verification modules are applied to judge whether the input face comes from the real-face space and the real-face distribution respectively.

To address this issue, we propose a novel face forgery detection framework, named Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL), which specially constructs positive and negative paired data and performs designed contrastive learning at different granularities to learn generalized feature representation. Concretely, combined with the hard sample selection strategy, Inter-Instance Contrastive Learning (Inter-ICL) is first proposed to promote task-related discriminative features learning by especially constructing instance pairs. Moreover, to further explore the essential discrepancies, Intra-Instance Contrastive Learning (Intra-ICL) is introduced to focus on the local content inconsistencies prevalent in the forged faces by constructing local-region pairs inside instances.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05830,Security,Adversarial Bone Length Attack on Action Recognition.,"Skeleton-based action recognition models have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images, perturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of approximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve this by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the perturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that adversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition models, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal manipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the skeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30 effective dimensions. We conducted experiments on the NTU RGB+D and HDM05 datasets and demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully deceived models with sometimes greater than 90% success rate by small perturbations. Furthermore, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: in our low-dimensional setting, the adversarial training with the bone length attack shares a similar property with data augmentation, and it not only improves the adversarial robustness but also improves the classification accuracy on the original data. This is an interesting counterexample of the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which has been widely observed in studies on adversarial training in the high-dimensional regime.",[],[],"['Nariki Tanaka', 'Hiroshi Kera', 'Kazuhiko Kawamoto']","['', '', '']",[]

To bridge the gap between digital attacks and physical attacks, we exploit the full 3D vehicle surface to propose a robust Full-coverage Camouflage Attack (FCA) to fool detectors. Specifically, we first try rendering the nonplanar camouflage texture over the full vehicle surface. To mimic the real-world environment conditions, we then introduce a transformation function to transfer the rendered camouflaged vehicle into a photo realistic scenario. Finally, we design an efficient loss function to optimize the camouflage texture.

As indicated in recent studies, adversarial examples are transferable, which makes it feasible for black-box attacks in real-world applications. Nevertheless, most existing adversarial attack methods have poor transferability when attacking other video models and transfer-based attacks on video models are still unexplored. To this end, we propose to boost the transferability of video adversarial examples for black-box attacks on video recognition models. Through extensive analysis, we discover that different video recognition models rely on different discriminative temporal patterns, leading to the poor transferability of video adversarial examples. This motivates us to introduce a temporal translation attack method, which optimizes the adversarial perturbations over a set of temporal translated video clips. By generating adversarial examples over translated videos, the resulting adversarial examples are less sensitive to temporal patterns existed in the white-box model being attacked and thus can be better transferred. Extensive experiments on the Kinetics-400 dataset and the UCF-101 dataset demonstrate that our method can significantly boost the transferability of video adversarial examples. For transfer-based attack against video recognition models, it achieves a 61.56% average attack success rate on the Kinetics-400 and 48.60% on the UCF-101.

In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03838,Security,Making Adversarial Examples More Transferable and Indistinguishable.,"Fast gradient sign attack series are popular methods that are used to generate adversarial examples. However, most of the approaches based on fast gradient sign attack series cannot balance the indistinguishability and transferability due to the limitations of the basic sign structure. To address this problem, we propose a method, called Adam Iterative Fast Gradient Tanh Method (AI-FGTM), to generate indistinguishable adversarial examples with high transferability. Besides, smaller kernels and dynamic step size are also applied to generate adversarial examples for further increasing the attack success rates. Extensive experiments on an ImageNet-compatible dataset show that our method generates more indistinguishable adversarial examples and achieves higher attack success rates without extra running time and resource. Our best transfer-based attack NI-TI-DI-AITM can fool six classic defense models with an average success rate of 89.3% and three advanced defense models with an average success rate of 82.7%, which are higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks. Additionally, our method can also reduce nearly 20% mean perturbation. We expect that our method will serve as a new baseline for generating adversarial examples with better transferability and indistinguishability.",[],[],"['Junhua Zou', 'Yexin Duan', 'Boyu Li', 'Wu Zhang', 'Yu Pan', 'Zhisong Pan']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06332,Security,Achieving Zero Constraint Violation for Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Primal-Dual Approach.,"Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications where one needs to perform sequential decisions while interacting with the environment. The problem becomes more challenging when the decision requirement includes satisfying some safety constraints. The problem is mathematically formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In the literature, various algorithms are available to solve CMDP problems in a model-free manner to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with $\epsilon$ feasible policies. An $\epsilon$-feasible policy implies that it suffers from constraint violation. An important question here is whether we can achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations or not. To achieve that, we advocate the use of randomized primal-dual approach to solve the CMDP problems and propose a conservative stochastic primal-dual algorithm (CSPDA) which is shown to exhibit $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations. In the prior works, the best available sample complexity for the $\epsilon$-optimal policy with zero constraint violation is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^5\right)$. Hence, the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement as compared to the state of the art.",[],[],"['Qinbo Bai', 'Amrit Singh Bedi', 'Mridul Agarwal', 'Alec Koppel', 'Vaneet Aggarwal']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12846,Security,HAGEN: Homophily-Aware Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Crime Forecasting.,"The crime forecasting is an important problem as it greatly contributes to urban safety. Typically, the goal of the problem is to predict different types of crimes for each geographical region (like a neighborhood or censor tract) in the near future. Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic characteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art solutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques could effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region nodes in the graph. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully capture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but share similar crime patterns. Hence, to make an accurate crime prediction, the main challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between regions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from historical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs for crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the crime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining an adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN, we propose a homophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph so that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime patterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. It also incorporates crime embedding to model the interdependencies between regions and crime categories. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN.",[],[],"['Chenyu Wang', 'Zongyu Lin', 'Xiaochen Yang', 'Jiao Sun', 'Mingxuan Yue', 'Cyrus Shahabi']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06757,Security,Blindfolded Attackers Still Threatening: Strict Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Graphs.,"Adversarial attacks on graphs have attracted considerable research interests. Existing works assume the attacker is either (partly) aware of the victim model, or able to send queries to it. These assumptions are, however, unrealistic. To bridge the gap between theoretical graph attacks and real-world scenarios, in this work, we propose a novel and more realistic setting: strict black-box graph attack, in which the attacker has no knowledge about the victim model at all and is not allowed to send any queries. To design such an attack strategy, we first propose a generic graph filter to unify different families of graph-based models. The strength of attacks can then be quantified by the change in the graph filter before and after attack. By maximizing this change, we are able to find an effective attack strategy, regardless of the underlying model. To solve this optimization problem, we also propose a relaxation technique and approximation theories to reduce the difficulty as well as the computational expense. Experiments demonstrate that, even with no exposure to the model, the Macro-F1 drops 6.4% in node classification and 29.5% in graph classification, which is a significant result compared with existent works.",[],[],"['Jiarong Xu', 'Yizhou Sun', 'Xin Jiang', 'Yanhao Wang', 'Yang Yang', 'Chunping Wang', 'Jiangang Lu']","['', '', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03762,Security,Defending Graph Convolutional Networks against Dynamic Graph Perturbations via Bayesian Self-Supervision.,"In recent years, plentiful evidence illustrates that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) achieve extraordinary accomplishments on the node classification task. However, GCNs may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks on label-scarce dynamic graphs. Many existing works aim to strengthen the robustness of GCNs; for instance, adversarial training is used to shield GCNs against malicious perturbations. However, these works fail on dynamic graphs for which label scarcity is a pressing issue. To overcome label scarcity, self-training attempts to iteratively assign pseudo-labels to highly confident unlabeled nodes but such attempts may suffer serious degradation under dynamic graph perturbations. In this paper, we generalize noisy supervision as a kind of self-supervised learning method and then propose a novel Bayesian self-supervision model, namely GraphSS, to address the issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSS can not only affirmatively alert the perturbations on dynamic graphs but also effectively recover the prediction of a node classifier when the graph is under such perturbations. These two advantages prove to be generalized over three classic GCNs across five public graph datasets.",[],[],"['Jun Zhuang', 'Mohammad Al Hasan']","['', '']",[]

While recent advances in deep learning (DL) provide a powerful approach to dealing with large-scale NSGs, DL methods such as NSG-NFSP suffer from the problem of data inefficiency. Furthermore, due to centralized control, they cannot scale to scenarios with a large number of resources. In this paper, we propose a novel DL-based method, NSGZero, to learn a non-exploitable policy in NSGs. NSGZero improves data efficiency by performing planning with neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our main contributions are threefold. First, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform neural MCTS in NSGs. Second, we enable neural MCTS with decentralized control, making NSGZero applicable to NSGs with many resources. Third, we provide an efficient learning paradigm, to achieve joint training of the DNNs in NSGZero.

For the resulting strategic game among the leaders, we show that pure Nash equilibria may fail to exist and therefore, we consider approximate equilibria instead. As our first main result, we show that the existence of a $K$-approximate equilibrium can always be guaranteed, where $K \approx 1.1974$ is the unique solution of a cubic polynomial equation. To this end, we give a polynomial time combinatorial algorithm which computes a $K$-approximate equilibrium. The factor $K$ is tight, meaning that there is an instance that does not admit an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium for any $\alpha<K$. Thus $\alpha=K$ is the smallest possible value of $\alpha$ such that the existence of an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium can be guaranteed for any instance of the considered game. Secondly, we focus on approximate equilibria of a given fixed instance. We show how to compute efficiently a best approximate equilibrium, that is, with smallest possible $\alpha$ among all $\alpha$-approximate equilibria of the given instance.",[],[],"['Tobias Harks', 'Mona Henle', 'Max Klimm', 'Jannik Matuschke', 'Anja Schedel']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14317,Security,Safe Subgame Resolving for Extensive Form Correlated Equilibrium.,"Correlated Equilibrium is a solution concept that is more general than Nash Equilibrium (NE) and can lead to outcomes with better social welfare. However, its natural extension to the sequential setting, the \textit{Extensive Form Correlated Equilibrium} (EFCE), requires a quadratic amount of space to solve, even in restricted settings without randomness in nature. To alleviate these concerns, we apply \textit{subgame resolving}, a technique extremely successful in finding NE in zero-sum games to solving general-sum EFCEs. Subgame resolving refines a correlation plan in an \textit{online} manner: instead of solving for the full game upfront, it only solves for strategies in subgames that are reached in actual play, resulting in significant computational gains. In this paper, we (i) lay out the foundations to quantify the quality of a refined strategy, in terms of the \textit{social welfare} and \textit{exploitability} of correlation plans, (ii) show that EFCEs possess a sufficient amount of independence between subgames to perform resolving efficiently, and (iii) provide two algorithms for resolving, one using linear programming and the other based on regret minimization.

To address some of these practical challenges, we develop a framework of generalized dynamic cognitive hierarchy for both modelling naturalistic human driving behavior as well as behavior planning for autonomous vehicles (AV). This framework is built upon a rich model of level-0 behavior through the use of automata strategies, an interpretable notion of bounded rationality through safety and maneuver satisficing, and a robust response for planning. Based on evaluation on two large naturalistic datasets as well as simulation of critical traffic scenarios, we show that i) automata strategies are well suited for level-0 behavior in a dynamic level-k framework, and ii) the proposed robust response to a heterogeneous population of strategic and non-strategic reasoners can be an effective approach for game theoretic planning in AV.",[],[],"['Atrisha Sarkar', 'Kate Larson', 'Krzysztof Czarnecki']","['', '', '']",[]

We consider the important class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as dynamic controllers for nonlinear uncertain partially-observed systems, and derive convex stability conditions based on integral quadratic constraints, S-lemma and sequential convexification. To ensure stability during the learning and control process, we propose a projected policy gradient method that iteratively enforces the stability conditions in the reparametrized space taking advantage of mild additional information on system dynamics. Numerical experiments show that our method learns stabilizing controllers while using fewer samples and achieving higher final performance compared with policy gradient.",[],[],"['Fangda Gu', 'He Yin', 'Laurent El Ghaoui', 'Murat Arcak', 'Peter Seiler', 'Ming Jin']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07701,Security,Conservative and Adaptive Penalty for Model-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in the real world must satisfy safety constraints in addition to maximizing a reward objective. Model-based RL algorithms hold promise for reducing unsafe real-world actions: they may synthesize policies that obey all constraints using simulated samples from a learned model. However, imperfect models can result in real-world constraint violations even for actions that are predicted to satisfy all constraints. We propose Conservative and Adaptive Penalty (CAP), a model-based safe RL framework that accounts for potential modeling errors by capturing model uncertainty and adaptively exploiting it to balance the reward and the cost objectives. First, CAP inflates predicted costs using an uncertainty-based penalty. Theoretically, we show that policies that satisfy this conservative cost constraint are guaranteed to also be feasible in the true environment. We further show that this guarantees the safety of all intermediate solutions during RL training. Further, CAP adaptively tunes this penalty during training using true cost feedback from the environment. We evaluate this conservative and adaptive penalty-based approach for model-based safe RL extensively on state and image-based environments. Our results demonstrate substantial gains in sample-efficiency while incurring fewer violations than prior safe RL algorithms.

In particular, our layer generates an input perturbation in the opposite direction of the adversarial one and feeds the classifier a perturbed version of the input. Our approach is training-free and theoretically supported. We verify the effectiveness of our approach by combining our layer with both nominally and robustly trained models and conduct large-scale experiments from black-box to adaptive attacks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

The goal of the reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging, and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem, we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments.",[],[],"['Kiarash Banihashem', 'Adish Singla', 'Jiarui Gan', 'Goran Radanovic']","['', 'Max Planck Institute for Software Systems', 'University of California, Los Angeles', '']",[]

However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of First-Order Logic. The method relies on an entropy-based criterion which automatically identifies the most relevant concepts. We consider four different case studies to demonstrate that: (i) this entropy-based criterion enables the distillation of concise logic explanations in safety-critical domains from clinical data to computer vision; (ii) the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art white-box models in terms of classification accuracy and matches black box performances.",[],[],"['Pietro Barbiero', 'Gabriele Ciravegna', 'Francesco Giannini', 'Pietro Lió', 'Marco Gori', 'Stefano Melacci']","['', '', '', '', '', '']",[]

The parameters that specify the linear safety constraints are unknown to the algorithm. The algorithm has access to only the noisy observations of constraints for the chosen actions. We propose an algorithm, called the {Safe Online Projected Gradient Descent} (SO-PGD) algorithm, to address this problem. We show that, under the assumption of the availability of a safe baseline action, the SO-PGD algorithm achieves a regret $O(T^{2/3})$. While there are many algorithms for online convex optimization (OCO) problems with safety constraints available in the literature, they allow constraint violations during learning/optimization, and the focus has been on characterizing the cumulative constraint violations.

Recent studies show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over single-step robust training methods.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10943,Security,Gradient Based Activations for Accurate Bias-Free Learning.,"Bias mitigation in machine learning models is imperative, yet challenging. While several approaches have been proposed, one view towards mitigating bias is through adversarial learning. A discriminator is used to identify the bias attributes such as gender, age or race in question. This discriminator is used adversarially to ensure that it cannot distinguish the bias attributes. The main drawback in such a model is that it directly introduces a trade-off with accuracy as the features that the discriminator deems to be sensitive for discrimination of bias could be correlated with classification. In this work we solve the problem. We show that a biased discriminator can actually be used to improve this bias-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, this is achieved by using a feature masking approach using the discriminator's gradients. We ensure that the features favoured for the bias discrimination are de-emphasized and the unbiased features are enhanced during classification. We show that this simple approach works well to reduce bias as well as improve accuracy significantly. We evaluate the proposed model on standard benchmarks.

In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems, and more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the policies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing differentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as Value Iteration, Deep Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We propose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL (PRIL) analysis framework, that performs reward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the agents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack, wherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using an Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed, we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07711,Security,Saving Stochastic Bandits from Poisoning Attacks via Limited Data Verification.,"We study bandit algorithms under data poisoning attacks in a bounded reward setting. We consider a strong attacker model in which the attacker can observe both the selected actions and their corresponding rewards and can contaminate the rewards with additive noise. We show that any bandit algorithm with regret $O(\log T)$ can be forced to suffer a regret $\Omega(T)$ with an expected amount of contamination $O(\log T)$. This amount of contamination is also necessary, as we prove that there exists an $O(\log T)$ regret bandit algorithm, specifically the classical UCB, that requires $\Omega(\log T)$ amount of contamination to suffer regret $\Omega(T)$. To combat such attacks, our second main contribution is to propose verification based mechanisms, which use limited verification to access a limited number of uncontaminated rewards. In particular, for the case of unlimited verifications, we show that with $O(\log T)$ expected number of verifications, a simple modified version of the ETC type bandit algorithm can restore the order optimal $O(\log T)$ regret irrespective of the amount of contamination used by the attacker. We also provide a UCB-like verification scheme, called Secure-UCB, that also enjoys full recovery from any attacks, also with $O(\log T)$ expected number of verifications. To derive a matching lower bound on the number of verifications, we prove that for any order-optimal bandit algorithm, this number of verifications $\Omega(\log T)$ is necessary to recover the order-optimal regret. On the other hand, when the number of verifications is bounded above by a budget $B$, we propose a novel algorithm, Secure-BARBAR, which provably achieves $O(\min\{C,T/\sqrt{B} \})$ regret with high probability against weak attackers where $C$ is the total amount of contamination by the attacker, which breaks the known $\Omega(C)$ lower bound of the non-verified setting if $C$ is large.",[],[],"['Anshuka Rangi', 'Long Tran-Thanh', 'Haifeng Xu', 'Massimo Franceschetti']","['', 'University of Southern California', 'Harvard University', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14738,Security,"With False Friends Like These, Who Can Notice Mistakes?","Adversarial examples crafted by an explicit adversary have attracted significant attention in machine learning. However, the security risk posed by a potential false friend has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we unveil the threat of hypocritical examples -- inputs that are originally misclassified yet perturbed by a false friend to force correct predictions. While such perturbed examples seem harmless, we point out for the first time that they could be maliciously used to conceal the mistakes of a substandard (i.e., not as good as required) model during an evaluation. Once a deployer trusts the hypocritical performance and applies the ""well-performed"" model in real-world applications, unexpected failures may happen even in benign environments. More seriously, this security risk seems to be pervasive: we find that many types of substandard models are vulnerable to hypocritical examples across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we provide the first attempt to characterize the threat with a metric called hypocritical risk and try to circumvent it via several countermeasures. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the countermeasures, while the risk remains non-negligible even after adaptive robust training.",[],[],"['Lue Tao', 'Lei Feng', 'Jinfeng Yi', 'Songcan Chen']","['', '', 'JD AI Research', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03857,Security,Robust Optimal Classification Trees against Adversarial Examples.,"Decision trees are a popular choice of explainable model, but just like neural networks, they suffer from adversarial examples. Existing algorithms for fitting decision trees robust against adversarial examples are greedy heuristics and lack approximation guarantees. In this paper we propose ROCT, a collection of methods to train decision trees that are optimally robust against user-specified attack models. We show that the min-max optimization problem that arises in adversarial learning can be solved using a single minimization formulation for decision trees with 0-1 loss. We propose such formulations in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Maximum Satisfiability, which widely available solvers can optimize. We also present a method that determines the upper bound on adversarial accuracy for any model using bipartite matching. Our experimental results demonstrate that the existing heuristics achieve close to optimal scores while ROCT achieves state-of-the-art scores.",[],[],"['Daniël Vos', 'Sicco Verwer']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09003,Security,Constraints Penalized Q-learning for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning.,"We study the problem of safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes long-term reward while satisfying safety constraints given only offline data, without further interaction with the environment. This problem is more appealing for real world RL applications, in which data collection is costly or dangerous. Enforcing constraint satisfaction is non-trivial, especially in offline settings, as there is a potential large discrepancy between the policy distribution and the data distribution, causing errors in estimating the value of safety constraints. We show that naïve approaches that combine techniques from safe RL and offline RL can only learn sub-optimal solutions. We thus develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Constraints Penalized Q-Learning (CPQ), to solve the problem. Our method admits the use of data generated by mixed behavior policies. We present a theoretical analysis and demonstrate empirically that our approach can learn robustly across a variety of benchmark control tasks, outperforming several baselines.",[],[],"['Haoran Xu', 'Xianyuan Zhan', 'Xiangyu Zhu']","['', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09677,Security,Training a Resilient Q-network against Observational Interference.,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive performance in various gaming simulators and real-world applications. In practice, however, a DRL agent may receive faulty observation by abrupt interferences such as black-out, frozen-screen, and adversarial perturbation. How to design a resilient DRL algorithm against these rare but mission-critical and safety-crucial scenarios is an essential yet challenging task. In this paper, we consider a deep q-network (DQN) framework training with an auxiliary task of observational interferences such as artificial noises. Inspired by causal inference for observational interference, we propose a causal inference based DQN algorithm called causal inference Q-network (CIQ). We evaluate the performance of CIQ in several benchmark DQN environments with different types of interferences as auxiliary labels. Our experimental results show that the proposed CIQ method could achieve higher performance and more resilience against observational interferences.",[],[],"['Chao-Han Huck Yang', 'I-Te Danny Hung', 'Yi Ouyang', 'Pin-Yu Chen']","['', '', '', 'IBM Research']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11542,Security,MIA-Former: Efficient and Robust Vision Transformers via Multi-Grained Input-Adaptation.,"ViTs are often too computationally expensive to be fitted onto real-world resource-constrained devices, due to (1) their quadratically increased complexity with the number of input tokens and (2) their overparameterized self-attention heads and model depth. In parallel, different images are of varied complexity and their different regions can contain various levels of visual information, indicating that treating all regions/tokens equally in terms of model complexity is unnecessary while such opportunities for trimming down ViTs' complexity have not been fully explored. To this end, we propose a Multi-grained Input-adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former that can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three coarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model heads/tokens). In particular, our MIA-Former adopts a low-cost network trained with a hybrid supervised and reinforcement training method to skip unnecessary layers, heads, and tokens in an input adaptive manner, reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, an interesting side effect of our MIA-Former is that its resulting ViTs are naturally equipped with improved robustness against adversarial attacks over their static counterparts, because MIA-Former's multi-grained dynamic control improves the model diversity similar to the effect of ensemble and thus increases the difficulty of adversarial attacks against all its sub-models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that the proposed MIA-Former framework can effectively allocate computation budgets adaptive to the difficulty of input images meanwhile increase robustness, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, e.g., 20% computation savings with the same or even a higher accuracy compared with SOTA dynamic transformer models.",[],[],"['Zhongzhi Yu', 'Yonggan Fu', 'Sicheng Li', 'Chaojian Li', 'Yingyan Lin']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06537,Security,Well-Classified Examples Are Underestimated in Classification with Deep Neural Networks.,"The conventional wisdom behind learning deep classification models is to focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples) contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD detection, and applications under adversarial attacks because our idea can solve these three issues.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13175,Security,Practical Fixed-Parameter Algorithms for Defending Active Directory Style Attack Graphs.,"Active Directory is the default security management system for Windows domain networks. We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker, where the expectation is taken over entry nodes. We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still $W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger graphs with more splitting nodes.",[],[],"['Mingyu Guo', 'Jialiang Li', 'Aneta Neumann', 'Frank Neumann', 'Hung Nguyen']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09447,Security,Algorithmic Fairness Verification with Graphical Models.,"In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been deployed in safety-critical and high-stake decision-making, where the fairness of algorithms is of paramount importance. Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling. In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers. We also demonstrate that FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence functions as a stepping stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets of features.",[],[],"['Bishwamittra Ghosh', 'Debabrota Basu', 'Kuldeep S.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03765,Security,Certified Robustness of Nearest Neighbors against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks.,"Data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks aim to corrupt a machine learning classifier via modifying, adding, and/or removing some carefully selected training examples, such that the corrupted classifier makes incorrect predictions as the attacker desires. The key idea of state-of-the-art certified defenses against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks is to create a majority vote mechanism to predict the label of a testing example. Moreover, each voter is a base classifier trained on a subset of the training dataset. Classical simple learning algorithms such as k nearest neighbors (kNN) and radius nearest neighbors (rNN) have intrinsic majority vote mechanisms. In this work, we show that the intrinsic majority vote mechanisms in kNN and rNN already provide certified robustness guarantees against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks. Moreover, our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the intrinsic certified robustness guarantees of kNN and rNN outperform those provided by state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results serve as standard baselines for future certified defenses against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks.",[],[],"['Jinyuan Jia', 'Yupei Liu', 'Xiaoyu Cao', 'Neil Zhenqiang Gong']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12662,Security,Sampling-Based Robust Control of Autonomous Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise.,"Controllers for autonomous systems that operate in safety-critical settings must account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modelled as process noise, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel planning method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target. First, we abstract the continuous system into a discrete-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP, and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the autonomous system. Realistic benchmarks show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has millions of states or transitions.",[],[],"['Thom S.

We propose an algorithm that naturally integrates predictions into the well-known Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm and significantly outperforms any known online algorithm if the prediction is of high accuracy while maintaining good guarantees when the prediction is of poor quality. We provide theoretical worst-case bounds that gracefully degrade with the prediction error, and we complement them by computational experiments that confirm our results. Further, we extend our concept to a general framework to robustify algorithms. By interpolating carefully between a given algorithm and NN, we prove new performance bounds that leverage the individual good performance on particular inputs while establishing robustness to arbitrary inputs.",[],[],"['Franziska Eberle', 'Alexander Lindermayr', 'Nicole Megow', 'Lukas Nölke', 'Jens Schlöter']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02563,Security,A Novel Approach to Solving Goal-Achieving Problems for Board Games.,"Goal-achieving problems are puzzles that set up a specific situation with a clear objective. An example that is well-studied is the category of life-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of identifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null moves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the opponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based approach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS tries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means we do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant algorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's super-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we also propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies AlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D problems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D book while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the approach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other goal-achieving problems for board games.",[],[],"['Chung-Chin Shih', 'Ti-Rong Wu', 'Ting Han Wei', 'I-Chen Wu']","['', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12709,Security,Adversarial Training for Improving Model Robustness? Look at Both Prediction and Interpretation.,"Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words. FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across different attacks.",[],[],"['Hanjie Chen', 'Yangfeng Ji']","['', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09381,Security,Synthetic Disinformation Attacks on Automated Fact Verification Systems.,"Automated fact-checking is a needed technology to curtail the spread of online misinformation. One current framework for such solutions proposes to verify claims by retrieving supporting or refuting evidence from related textual sources. However, the realistic use cases for fact-checkers will require verifying claims against evidence sources that could be affected by the same misinformation. Furthermore, the development of modern NLP tools that can produce coherent, fabricated content would allow malicious actors to systematically generate adversarial disinformation for fact-checkers. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of automated fact-checkers to synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition, where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered. Our study across multiple models on three benchmarks demonstrates that these systems suffer significant performance drops against these attacks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02701,Security,Protecting Intellectual Property of Language Generation APIs with Lexical Watermark.,"Nowadays, due to the breakthrough in natural language generation (NLG), including machine translation, document summarization, image captioning, etc NLG models have been encapsulated in cloud APIs to serve over half a billion people worldwide and process over one hundred billion word generations per day. Thus, NLG APIs have already become essential profitable services in many commercial companies. Due to the substantial financial and intellectual investments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote sustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud platforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks, which aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus violating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at protecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized watermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing watermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG APIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text generation APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs. Compared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better identifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In addition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than the baselines. Finally, the empirical studies show our approach is also applicable to queries from different domains, and is effective on the attacker trained on a mixture of the corpus which includes less than 10\% watermarked samples.",[],[],"['Xuanli He', 'Qiongkai Xu', 'Lingjuan Lyu', 'Fangzhao Wu', 'Chenguang Wang']","['', '', '', '', '']",[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10424,Security,Unifying Model Explainability and Robustness for Joint Text Classification and Rationale Extraction.,"Recent works have shown explainability and robustness are two crucial ingredients of trustworthy and reliable text classification. However, previous works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales for explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively, a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end, we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC. It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information. Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the attack success rate effectively by up to 69%.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08900,Security,A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information: Application to Crop Yield Prediction.,"Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance.

Consequently, YouTube Kids' content should receive an additional level of scrutiny to ensure children's safety. While research on detecting offensive or inappropriate content for kids is gaining momentum, little or no current work exists that investigates to what extent AI applications can (accidentally) introduce content that is inappropriate for kids. In this paper, we present a novel (and troubling) finding that well-known automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may produce text content highly inappropriate for kids while transcribing YouTube Kids' videos. We dub this phenomenon as \emph{inappropriate content hallucination}. Our analyses suggest that such hallucinations are far from occasional, and the ASR systems often produce them with high confidence.

However, the development of such systems has been limited due to a lack of publicly labeled multivariate time series (MTS) sensor data. MTS classification has advanced greatly over the past decade, but there is a lack of sufficiently challenging benchmarks for new methods. This work introduces the NGAFID Maintenance Classification (NGAFID-MC) dataset as a novel benchmark in terms of difficulty, number of samples, and sequence length. NGAFID-MC consists of over 7,500 labeled flights, representing over 11,500 hours of per second flight data recorder readings of 23 sensor parameters. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods are not well suited for capturing temporally distant relationships and propose a new architecture called Convolutional Multiheaded Self Attention (Conv-MHSA) that achieves greater classification performance at greater computational efficiency. We also demonstrate that image inspired augmentations of cutout, mixup, and cutmix, can be used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization in MTS classification. Our best trained models have been incorporated back into the NGAFID to allow users to potentially detect flights that require maintenance as well as provide feedback to further expand and refine the NGAFID-MC dataset.",[],[],"['Hong Yang', 'Aidan LaBella', 'Travis Desell']","['', '', '']",[]
